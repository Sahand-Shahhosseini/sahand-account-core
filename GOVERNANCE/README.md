# GOVERNANCE (Account Core)

This folder is **operational protocol**, not theory.

It answers:
- how Sahand works with GitHub with **minimal friction**
- how ChatGPT/Codex loop is executed
- what is considered **DONE** vs **PARTIAL** vs **FAIL**

## Documents
- `GITHUB_IPAD_PROTOCOL_v0_1.md` : iPad-only workflow (review runs, download SAFE bundles, light edits)
- `GITHUB_DESKTOP_PROTOCOL_v0_1.md` : Windows GitHub Desktop workflow (clone, copy patch, commit, push)
- `RELEASE_PROTOCOL_v0_1.md` : tagging + ReleasePack publication rules
